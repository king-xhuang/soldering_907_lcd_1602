SCREEN* calibSCREEN -- IRON CALIBRATION 

in configSCREEN select config, short push handle and then jump to calibSCREEN::menu() screen 1 to select reference temp.

calibSCREEN::menu(void) -

1. show reference temp (200, 300, 400) at left top corner. rotate encoder to select one of them. When short push handle, you get into
screen 2.  On this screen you can long push the handle to save the cali data and return to mainSCREEN.

2. show reference temp at left top corner and current temp and sensor reading  at 2nd line. use external thermal sensor to measure 
iron tip temp. After external thermal sensor reading stable, turn the encoder to  make current temp (at left bottom concer) reading be the
